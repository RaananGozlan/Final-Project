            The Sudoku puzzle grid you will be presented with is partly filled, <br/>
            and has only one correct solution.<br/><br>
            Your objective is to correctly fill every empty cell on the grid with a color<br/>
            according to the given declaration and the instructions and rules.<br/>
            The task will begin with a first impression phase, in which you will have a few <br/>
            seconds of a first glance on the puzzle, followed by a question appearing on the screen. <br/><br>
            After answering the first impression question, <br/>
            you will be able to start the puzzle-solving task, by clicking on “Start Game”.<br/>
            You will have 15 minutes to solve the puzzle. <br/>
            If you have finished filling the entire grid before the time limits expire,  <Br/>
            you can press the 'Finish Game’, and continue to the next page.<br/>
